# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## HOMEWORK/TECHNICAL TASKS

### Docker Containers
I created Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend then containerized both of them 
I then created a Dockercompose file as per the youtube Videos, did docker-compose up and build both containers.

# Issues encountered and how to solve:
- My Gitpod work space could not dispaly my files for the entire week had to shift to Codespaces after trying to create a new repo.
- While trying to push my images to DockerHub received request denied. I ued this documentation for guidance (stackoverflow)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41984399/denied-requested-access-to-the-resource-is-denied-docker]
