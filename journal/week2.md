# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing


## HOMEWORK/TECHNICAL TASKS
I instrumented the backend flask application to use Open Telemetry with Honeycomb.io as the provider

I then run queires to explore tarces with Honeycomb then instrument AWS X-Ray into backend flask application.

I also integrated Rollbar for Error Logging and triggered error logging.
