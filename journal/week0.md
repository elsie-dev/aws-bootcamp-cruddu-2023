## HOMEWORK CHALLENEGS


## KEY TAKEAWAYS:
* While installing the AWS CLI on the Gitpod rem to __NOT__ use aws configure for the credential instaed use the export aws since this is an enviroment variable that we don't intend to be committed. 
* Also ensure you are in the right folder not inside the working directory for your crudder project
* Creating and Viewing Budgets might return an error from the user account, ensure to specify the billing policies to have access.
* Saving your AWS account ID, region, secret and access key to avoid starting afresh on gitpod everytime is highyl recommended.
