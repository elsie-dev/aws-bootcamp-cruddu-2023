## TASK ACCOMPLISHED.
 ### Created Two budgets on AWS:
__One for ZeroSpend Budget__ - Notifies when my spending exceed areforecasted to exceed the free tier limit.

__Credit Limit Budget__ - Covers costs used in billings for the allowed resources.
For the two budgets included notification emails and action( stopping the EC2 when limit is exceeded)

Next is navigating to the project repo, then using the gitpod button we navigate to vscode. 
Installing AWS CLI
```curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

*Note:* While installing the AWS CLI ensure you check your current directory then move to the aws folder using **cd..** and this is where we install the  aws cli. __Reason__:(Installing it in the wrong place,with gitpod everything in the directpry gets committed.)

We also don't use **aws configure** instaed for the environment variables instead we use:
export AWS_ACCESSKEY, export AWS SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION

To confirm identity we use ```aws sts get-caller-identity```

Next is Creating the AWS CLI Budget, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/index.html
